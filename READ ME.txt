implement the actual store elements. Updated layouts and added mobile layouts within the Blueprint folder.

Did a complete redesign of the site to fit the more updated blueprint. 
Created a responsive nav bar, and wrote cleaner mark up and started to make the rest of the site responsive aswell.
--- Updated Contact and About pages and made them responsive.

5/5/20
Added the cart in nav bar,and cart page with JavaScript elements.

Scrapped the previous JavaScript for simpler code, decided to go back to the original Home page plan and not
do a carousel due to time. Inclueded the Cart section onto the Store page. Made all pages responsive.

Personal Sidenote: I learned a lot from this program and working on this project, I struggled with 
time due to personal matters as explained to Eric Kepner, but none the less I'm proud of the work I've done 
and am happy to turn it in. I have reccommended the program to some friends and one signed up for the next round
of classes. Thank you to all the mentors and program associates who make Code Louisville happen.
